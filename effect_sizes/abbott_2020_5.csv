"Abbott et al. (2020) J. Evol. Biol. 33, 738–750",Egg-to-adult survival,40,Drosophila melanogaster,"A positive effect size would indicates elevated egg-to-adult survival in the progeny of females carrying a male-evolved X chromosome relative to females carrying control genomes. Note that all sons and 50% daughters actually inherit the male-evolved X from the tester females. There is seemingly no difference based on the available data, though the authors find that MLX has greater survival than the control in a quasibinomial GLM presented in the supplement.",0.14,0.03,-0.22,0.5
